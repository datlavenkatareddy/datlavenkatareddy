## 👋 About Me

I’m a **B.Tech Computer Science student** focused on becoming a **top‑tier AI systems engineer**. I don’t chase trends or copy tutorials — I design, build, and refine **foundational systems** that emphasize **control, robustness, and long‑term intelligence**.

My work is driven by one question:

> *How do we make intelligent systems behave more like skilled humans — fast, adaptive, and reliable under pressure?*

## 🚀 Flagship Work

### 🧠 Computational Muscle Memory (CMM)

**A control‑layer architecture inspired by human muscle memory.**

Instead of treating overrides, corrections, or failures as errors, CMM treats them as **learnable reflexes**.

**Core pipeline:**

* Experience logging
* Pattern extraction
* Reflex store
* Override engine

**Why it matters:**

* Faster response over time
* Increased robustness under distribution shifts
* Engineering‑first design (no unnecessary heavy ML)

This project reflects how I think about intelligence: **structure before scale, control before chaos**.

## 🧪 Selected Projects

### 🔹 Stability Score

A Python package that evaluates **model interpretation stability** under perturbations:

* Bootstrapping
* Noise injection
* Missing data
* Outliers

Includes quantitative scoring and visualization (radar plots, dashboards). Designed for *trust*, not just accuracy.

### 🔹 QuickSum

A lightweight summarization utility focused on speed, clarity, and practical usage.

### 🔹 Web & Full‑Stack Work

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript
* Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

---

## 🧠 Technical Focus

* Data Structures & Algorithms (problem‑solving rigor)
* Object‑Oriented Design (Java)
* Python for ML & system prototyping
* Full‑stack engineering
* AI system design (LLMs, memory, reasoning, control layers)

---


## 🎯 Long‑Term Vision

To engineer an **All‑in‑One AI System with Real‑Time Human Intelligence**, integrating:

* Language, vision, and speech
* Persistent memory
* Reflex‑like response mechanisms
* Human‑aligned control layers

Not demos. Not wrappers. **Real systems.**

> I value clarity over noise, fundamentals over fashion, and systems that work under pressure.
