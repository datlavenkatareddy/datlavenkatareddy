## 👋 About Me

I’m a **B.Tech Computer Science student** focused on becoming a **top‑tier AI systems engineer**. I don’t chase trends or copy tutorials — I design, build, and refine **foundational systems** that emphasize **control, robustness, and long‑term intelligence**.

My work is driven by one question:

> *How do we make intelligent systems behave more like skilled humans — fast, adaptive, and reliable under pressure?*

## 🚀 Flagship Work

### 🧠 Computational Muscle Memory (CMM)

**A control‑layer architecture inspired by human muscle memory.**

Instead of treating overrides, corrections, or failures as errors, CMM treats them as **learnable reflexes**.

**Core pipeline:**
🧪 Selected Projects

🔹 Stability Score

A rigorous evaluation framework for model reliability.

A Python package that measures how stable a model’s explanations remain under real‑world data perturbations.

Bootstrapping

Noise injection

Missing data

Outliers


Includes quantitative scoring and visual diagnostics (radar plots, dashboards) to assess whether a model can be trusted, not just whether it is accurate.

🔹 QuickSum

A production‑minded document summarization system.

Built to turn long PDFs into clean, structured summaries with minimal latency. Designed for practical use rather than academic demos.

🔹 Web & Full‑Stack Engineering

End‑to‑end application development.

Experience building complete systems using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript

Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB


Focus on clean architecture, fast iteration, and deployable software.

## 🧠 Technical Focus

* Data Structures & Algorithms (problem‑solving rigor)
* Object‑Oriented Design (Java)
* Python for ML & system prototyping
* Full‑stack engineering
* AI system design (LLMs, memory, reasoning, control layers)

---


## 🎯 Long‑Term Vision

To engineer an **All‑in‑One AI System with Real‑Time Human Intelligence**, integrating:

* Language, vision, and speech
* Persistent memory
* Reflex‑like response mechanisms
* Human‑aligned control layers

Not demos. Not wrappers. **Real systems.**

> I value clarity over noise, fundamentals over fashion, and systems that work under pressure.
